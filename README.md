Digitizing Nosaby Excavation Report


This repository was created as part of the Digitization for preservation and accessibility course at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se/). It documents the digitization of a historical excavation report from the [Historical museum at Lund's University](https://www.historiskamuseet.lu.se/) authored by Olof Källström in October 1922, covering a follow-up excavation in Nosaby (Kristianstad, Sweden). The project includes metadata, descriptive information, and digital files designed for long-term access and presentation on GitHub. The structure is based on a template from [Wout Dillen ](https://github.com/SSLIS/DCHM-template) that has been modified to suit the purposes of this project. The material is not protected by copyright and is free for anyone to use.
